### Green Team Q2: Molecular Targets and Biological Pathways of PM2.5 and Ozone

## Query:

What protein (gene) targets and biological pathways are activated or inhibited by particulate matter <=2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone exposure?

## Goal:

Airborne pollutants such as PM2.5 and ozone can trigger asthma exacerbations; however, susceptibility varies among patients with asthma, in part because asthma is best considered a 'syndrome' with multiple underlying 'endotypes'. This query should identify the molecular targets and biological pathways that are altered as a result of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone. As such, the query should provide mechanistic insight into the underlying etiology and pathophysiology of asthma.

## Data Types, Sources, and Routes:
CTD: human proteins/genes

KEGG, Reactome (via CTD): biological pathways

**Input:** ‘PM2.5’ or ‘particulate matter’; ‘ozone’

1. List protein (gene) targets for PM2.5
2. List protein (gene) targets for ozone exposure
3. Identify commonalities in (1) and (2)
4. List up/downstream biological pathways affected by protein (gene) targets in (3) and whether the interaction is activation or inhibition
5. Rank output from (3) by frequency (most common to least common)
6. Rank output from (4) by frequency (most common to least common)

**Output:** (1) Ranked list of protein (gene) targets shared by PM2.5 and ozone; (2) Ranked list of biological pathways affected by protein (gene) targets shared by PM2.5 and ozone
