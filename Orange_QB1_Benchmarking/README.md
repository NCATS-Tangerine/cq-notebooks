This directory holds a set of elemental Benchmarking queries that can be executed to assess the scope, content, and evolution of data in the Translator system over time. These should be simple retrieval/filtering queries that can be executed with a minimal number of steps. 

Queries are being developed and staged for implementation in the google spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wbP1Ykryibcan2ZgZTOmnGp9WjcRE7nNig3akiq0PuY/edit#gid=1337100562).  When a query is ready for implmentation in a Jupyter notebook, a new folder is created in this `Orange_QB1_Benchmarking` directory, and seeded with a **README file** that describes the query. An example with of a README with instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/cq-notebooks/blob/master/Contributor_Docs/cq_readme_template.md), and an empty template for Benchmarking query README file is below.

In addition to the README file, a **Github issue** is created for each notebook to track status, owndership, and outcomes.  Instructions and a template for this ticket are [here](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/cq-notebooks/blob/master/Contributor_Docs/notebook_status_ticket_template.md). 

More information about Benchmarking Query staging and development processes can be found in the Contributor Documentation [here](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/cq-notebooks/blob/master/Contributor_Docs/Query_Bank_Development.md). General information about Translator CQ development can be found [here](https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/cq-notebooks/blob/master/Contributor_Docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
