## Orange QB1.7

### Query:
Return sequences of FA genes that have had compensatory changes leading to resistance of chemotherapeutic agents  (e.g.cisplatin)

#### Refined Query:
What compensatory mutations in FA core  genes confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. cisplatin)?

### Goal:
A benchmarking query to assess information in the Translator system about variants and their effects.

### Notes:
If CIViC's 'Predictive' variant associations address this question, it is supported now by WD and will soon be by Monarch.
Civic classified these types of associations as "Resistance or Non-Response", so the results will include both.
See for example [here](https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/events/genes/7/summary/variants/186/summary/evidence/1776/summary#evidence).
