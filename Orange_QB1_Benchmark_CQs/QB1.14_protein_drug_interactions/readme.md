### Query:

Return all known protein-drug interactions 

### Refined Query:

What drugs are known to interact with FA proteins (e.g. BRCA2)

### Goal:

A benchmarking query to assess information in the Translator system about protein-drug interactions


### Proposed Data Types, Sources, and Access Endpoints:
1. IUPHAR (through wikidata)
2. 


### Proposed Sub-Queries/Tasks:
**Input:** FA Gene X  (used FANCC and BRCA2 as exemplars):
   
**Output:** Set of drugs interacting with FA gene(s) and the type of interaction (inhibitor/activator/etc)
