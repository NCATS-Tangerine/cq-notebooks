## Fanconi Anemia gene sets

These first appeared in the [2_27_Blue-orange team Fanconi gene sets and clinical variables](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yX-5sfrC3vrahf4_k7-5rl4Oqzm853ollIMmUo1PTc0/edit#gid=1185309083)  
 online shared document as:
 
|set|name|count|  
|---|---|---|  
|SET-1| FA-core complex /D2I complex|11|
|SET-2| FA-effector proteins|10|
|SET-3| FAAP|>5|

Where, the lists were attached as hidden comments on the counts.  
(you are forgiven for not noticing)  

The lists are of current or previous symbols and other names.
Current gene symbols are directly translated to NCBI gene identifiers
and other names were run through [MyGene](http://myGene.info) to find the current symbol and
gene identifier.
